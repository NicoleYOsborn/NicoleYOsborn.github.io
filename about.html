        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/headshotcropped.jpg">
        <p>My life has been a journey of wandering intellectual interests with no clear indication of where it was
            heading. That is, until a few years ago when I discovered User Experience Design and realized that this was
            where I was meant to be all along.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <p class="snippet">When I started college, I found every topic so fascinating, I wanted to take every 101
                course I could! I filled my schedule with intro courses - Geology, Art History, World Religions,
                Chemistry, Psychology, Anthropology, Forestry, Calculus and Spanish - until my counselor told me I would
                have to choose a major. I chose <strong>Anthropology</strong> because within it were so many fascinating
                topics - Archaeology, Ethnography, Linguistics, Primatology and Physical/Biological Anthropology! I
                loved learning about how culture influences human behavior, but I knew it would not be my career.</p>
            <img src="./images/archeology.png">
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <img src="./images/brain-clipart-transparent-background-22.png">
            <p class="snippet">Years later, while working at University of Phoenix, I could not resist the appeal of taking courses with my
            employee discount. I earned a Master of Science in <strong>Psychology</strong>, and loved studying how the
            human mind works! But I knew I did not want a career as a counselor or psychologist.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A few years after that I got the itch to take more courses, and I was fascinated by computers and technology,
            so I signed up for an A+ Fundamentals certificate program. I enjoyed that so much, I decided I might as well
            go for the Associate of Arts in <strong>Information Technology</strong>! Within that program I earned a
            certificate in Database Management. It was my first introduction to programming using SQL, and I loved
            figuring out how to solve problems with code. But I knew I didn't really want a career in database
            management.</p>
        
        <div class="row">
        <p class="snippet">After a few years, when I needed some more intellectual stimulation, I returned to coding but this time I
            took a free course from Google on <strong>Android development</strong>. I was able to create fun little
            games and put them on my phone! Now, that was fun!</p>
            <img src="./images/web-development-the-c-programming-language-computer-programming-others.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>It was at that point that I began researching Web Development programs, and came across something called
            <strong>UX Design</strong>. When I discovered that this is a career that requires the desire to understand
            people and their needs and motivation (Anthropology and Psychology!), and it involves creating apps and
            websites to fulfill people's needs (coding and technology!), and it is a career that is always bringing new
            challenges and new things to learn about, I knew I had finally <strong>found my calling!</strong></p>
        <p>I started taking courses at <a herf="https://www.interaction-design.org/">Interaction Design Foundation</a>
            and absolutely loved it! I enrolled in Lambda School to study UX Design, and went on to also complete the
            Web Development program as well. And the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
            <img src="./images/graphic-design-transparent-24.png">
        <p>So if you are looking for a UX Designer or Web Developer with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a desire
            to create delightful experiences, then look no further! <strong>I am ready for the next big
                adventure!</strong></p>
