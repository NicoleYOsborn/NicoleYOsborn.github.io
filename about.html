    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/headshotcropped.jpg">
    <p>I am a lifelong learner fascinated with understanding people. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology (the study of people!) in 2002, and a Master of Science in Psychology in 2009. Although I never worked in those fields specifically, my thirst for information is ongoing as I am an avid consumer of science and psychology articles and podcasts.</p> 
    <p>I discovered UX Design as a career possibility in 2019 and I dove right in! I realize now that in every job I have ever had, I have received the most joy and satisfaction from finding and solving problems for people. As a UX Designer, I use research, data, and current knowledge of human psychology to solve problems and provide great experiences.</p>
