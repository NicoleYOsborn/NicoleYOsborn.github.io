        <h1>Quest for the Best</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <h4><strong>Motivating users to get out of the house and have adventures!</strong></h4>
            <img src="../images/QuestPhoneImage.png" alt="image of mobile phone with a chat screen" />
        </div>
        <p>This was a school assignment and it was a <strong>one week solo project.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>The premise</strong> - Quest for the Best is a mobile app that encourages people to get out more by
            having them create a “Quest” and a group of their friends can choose to participate in the quest by going to
            activities/events/restaurants and rating their experience.</p>
        <p><strong>The problem </strong>- my goal was to create an in-app chat for the project, as well as a way to
            document past quests.
        </p>

        <h4><strong>How might we use a chat feature to improve the experience of this app?</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>Insights</strong> - I wanted to know why someone would want to use an in-app chat feature rather than
            communicating through existing channels. My conclusion, based on input from the Stakeholder Interview and
            Competitive Analysis, was that it would be a chat that is specifically created for the quest and would be a
            great way to coordinate outings with friends who are also completing the quest. So I decided to design the
            chats as quest specific chat rooms.</p>

        <h4><strong>Ideation</strong></h4>
        <div class="row">
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/Crazy8s 1.png" alt="a piece of paper with multiple sketches of user interfaces" />
                <figcaption>I used the <strong>"Crazy 8s" </strong>technique to brainstorm 8 possible layouts in 8
                    minutes.</figcaption>

            <figure>

                <figcaption><strong>Storyboard</strong> sketch of all screens needed for the chat feature.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/QuestUserFlowMap 1.png"
                    alt="a flow map showing the user flow from User Page -> Message Listing -> Quest specific chat">
                <figcaption><strong>Site Maps and User Flows</strong> like this one helped me to understand how the chat
                    feature fits in to the user's experience.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="snippet">With only a week to implement the feature, I spent the first day brainstorming and
                planning. I wanted to focus on answering the question of how to enrich the Quest experience with the
                chat feature. Once I had a storyboard, I was ready to move on to <strong>Wireframing!</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h4><strong>User Testing with Low Fidelity Prototype</strong></h4>
        <figure>
            <img src="../images/heatmaps.png" alt="three screens of user interfaces with heatmap of user clicks">
            <figcaption>Wire-frames were created using <strong>Figma</strong>. User testing was conducted using
                <strong>Optimal Workshop</strong>.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>One of the challenges of conducting a solo UX project is finding willing participants for user testing! I was able to recruite 11 people by soliciting to classmates, friends and family to do a quick usability study. I used a "first click" test on my early wireframes to verify that users found it intuitive to navigate the chat feature. With a whopping <strong>90% success rate</strong>, I felt confident in the design, and moved on to creating a <strong>High Fidelity</strong> mockup.</p>

        <h4><strong>Design System and High Fidelity Prototype</strong></h4>

        <div class="row">
            <p class="snippet">In order to choose the <strong>color palette</strong>, I revisited color theory. This app should be fun and exciting, and I found the colors that signify fun (yellows and oranges) and novelty (purple) would be good for this app. I used the tool at <a href="colorizer.org">colorizer.org</a> to find a complementary pair. I started out using a shade of yellow with purple, but did not like how it looked. So I played with the purple shade and found a complementary orange color that looked appealing and used those to create the color palette. </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/ColorPalette 1.png" alt="Image shows a color palette of shades of purple, orange, and grayscale."/>
            </figure>        
        </div>
        <p>Using <strong>atomic design theory</strong> I set about creating reusable components and set up a <strong>high fidelity prototype</strong> in figma, which could be used in <strong>live user testing.</strong></p>

            <img src="../images/ProrotypeImage 1.png" alt="Image shows four screens of a prototype with arrows denoting results of user actions"/>
        </figure>

        <h4><strong>Verifying Results</strong></h4>
        <div class="row">

            </figure>
            <p class="snippet">I completed live user testing with two people. I had users attempt these tasks - locating the chats, finding new messages, and looking at completed quests. They had no problems accomplishing these tasks and expressed that they would enjoy an app like this!</p>
        </div>
        <p>Having validated my design choices with user testing, I went back to carefully cleaning up the design adjusting margins to make sure things lined up well. <strong>Here is the final product!</strong></p>
        </p>

        <h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
        <p>This quick solo project was a great experience, allowing me to gain confidence in my UX process and UI skills. Through user research, I found that an app like "Quest for the Best" would find significant market demand. I would enjoy working on the full app to meet that demand! </p>
