                <h4>
                    <strong>Giving scholars a way to connect with advisors and collaborators, provide peer review, and more!</strong>
                </h4>
                <img src="../images/OpenbookMockupImage.png" alt="image of mobile phone with a Lambda School student dashboard interface"/>
            </div>
            <p>This was a
                <strong>paid contract position.</strong>
                I worked with openbook founder Jay Gopolan as a solo UX Designer. The UX Design process was one month, after which I worked as a developer, building out the designed components in ReactJS.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>The problem</strong>
                - Many scholars in developing nations without a university affiliation are unable to access peer review, advisement, and collaboration on their research.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>The premise
                </strong>- Our goal is to create an application that removes those barriers to access, allowing these scholars to improve their academic credential.</p>

            <h4>
                <strong>How might we meet the needs of scholars without a university affiliation?</strong>
            </h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights</strong>
                - Based on early research, the target demographic in India and other developing countries accesses the internet mostly on their smartphone, and they are most likely to have the Android operating system. Based on these findings, we decided to design for mobile first. I began building out a userflow for the mobile app.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/openbookuserflow.png" alt="User flow map shows many possible interactions with the app.">
                <figcaption>I used
                    <strong>Whimsical</strong>
                    to map out a detailed user flow for the mobile app.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>
                <strong>Ideation</strong>
            </h4>
            <div class="row">
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>I started some rapid wireframing ideas using Whimsical so that I could easily get feedback from Jay on design ideas.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                    <figcaption>I did some iterating on different ideas for the home page and navigation of the app.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>By the end of the first week, I had many iterations of all of the screens which would be needed for the user flows of the mobile app. I had some questions that I needed user feedback on in order to continue at this point. Jay had a group of stakeholders that he would be willing to send a survey to, so I created a survey and it was sent out on Friday so that I would be able to evaluate the results on Monday.</p>

            <h4>
                <strong>Survey results</strong>
            </h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/openbookSurveyLandingPage.png" alt="A bar graph for “Where does a scholar land when opening the app or logging in?” shows Personal Profile was chosen 6.67% of the time, Newsfeed of suggested research was chosen 86.67% of the time, and news feed of suggested connections was chosen 6.67% of the time.">
                <figcaption>Wire-frames were created using
                    <strong>Figma</strong>.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The respondents overwhelmingly felt that the newsfeed of suggested research was the best place to land when opening the app. They also helped make a decision on which term to use for a scholar’s connections to others as an advisor, student, or collaborator. I was surprised by the feedback that tapping on a card for research or for a scholar profile should open up an overlay rather than navigate to a new page.</p>

            <h4>
                <strong>Learning the brand's aesthetic</strong>
            </h4>

            <p>Before beginning to build higher fidelity mockups in Figma, I needed to get familiar with the brand's established style guide. It came with specific instructions on colors, and fonts, and logos. Other than that, I only had the website to understand the company's brand. With those as my guide, I built the color pallette and font styles in Figma and began iterating.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="snippet">The website used the bluish "neutral" color for a background, and "openbook orange" as an accent color. It also had floating "card" style boxes for information. I used that as inspiration for my first mid-fidelity mockups in Figma.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/openbookFirstFigmaWireframes.png" alt="Image shows mobile interface with light blue background, orange logo at top, and cards with paper titles and authors."/>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Unfortunately, the company founder felt like the bright and fun tone of the colors I chose did not portray the brand in the way that he wanted. He wants it to feel sophisticated and luxurious and that we should use the dark “mature blue” for a background with the brighter yellow-orange logo better portrays that image.
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <figure>
                    <img
                    src="../images/openbookFigmaIteration1.png" alt="Image shows navigation bar before and after adding text labels"/>

                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img
                    class="figmaWireframe" src="../images/openbookFigmaIteration2.png" alt="Image shows navigation bar before and after adding text labels"/>
    
                </figure>

                <figure>
                    <img
                    class="figmaWireframe" src="../images/openbookFigmaIteration3.png" alt="Image shows navigation bar before and after adding text labels"/>

                </figure>
            </div>

        <p>I changed the colors, keeping the rest of the design, but there were a few things that didn’t seem aesthetically pleasing. The white cards almost hurt the eyes with the very dark background.</P>
        <p>So I tried it with the light blue background still behind the cards, but the dark background and logo at top, but the style just didn’t seem to flow.</p>

        <p>Then, I ditched the idea of the floating cards altogether and went with a more modern style of cards extending across the entire screen, only separated by a gray line. In this iteration, I also tried getting rid of the menu in favor of bottom navigation and icons for the search and profile and settings, with a floating action button for the main action of submitting a paper.</p>


        <h4>
            <strong>Usability Testing</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>I recieved approval to create tests on <strong>UsabilityHub</strong> and order 30 testers for each. I used a first click test to make sure people could navigate the landing page. I also created an A/B preference test to see if users liked my new floating action menu, or if they preferred a traditional drawer menu accessed with a hamburger icon in the top nav bar. I set up the tests, and Jay ordered 30 participants each. Our responses came within an hour. This was much easier than trying to recruit people to test my products for free, I could get used to this!
        </p>

        <div class="row">
        <figure>
            <img src="../images/openbookFirstClickSubmitPaper.png" alt="Mobile interface with spots showing where testers first clicked, with the majority clusted on the menu icon"/>
            <figcaption>The first test asked where you would click first if your goal is to submit a new paper. The majority of the clicks are on the menu icon, which validates the decision to have “submit a paper” in the main menu.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="snippet">
            <strong>Insights:</strong>  I felt very confident that my floating action menu was great for mobile phone usability, as it moved the main menu in thumb tapping distance rather than at the top of the screen. It also gives it a fun and modern feel. But, as I will often be reminded, I am not the user. This test of users in our demographic (highly educated people in India) showed a clear preference for the drawer menu. Reasons people gave were that it was simple and clear.
        </p>
    </div>


            <h4><strong>Live Prototype Usability Interviews</strong></h4>
        
        <p>I conducted two live user interviews over <strong>Zoom</strong>, which allows me to record the session for later review. During user interviews I found that people had difficulty understanding what the “Research” and “Network” tabs on the bottom navigation really meant. These are news feeds to browse suggested research and connections based on our algorithms. So I changed the labeling to say “Browse Research” and “Grow your Network” to better represent their function.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/openbookBottomNavUpdates.png" alt="Original bottom nav with labels 'Research' and 'Network', and updated nav with labels 'Browse Research' and 'Grow Your Network'"/>
        </figure>

        <p>I received some feedback from new teammates regarding the thumbs up and thumbs down icons. She felt that it gives it a judgey feel and assumed that it meant “like or dislike”. I realized it didn’t appropriately convey the meaning which is actually “More like this” or “less like this” to help our algorithm in suggesting research or people. So I thought maybe something that looks more like the arrows from Reddit. So I created three different versions of the cards and had people vote on which they felt gave the correct meaning of the icons. I called them “Social media style”, “Pandora style”, and “Reddit style”. </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/openbookCardStyles.png" alt="Different versions of research cards with thumbs up and thumbs down icnos vs arrow up and down icons"/>
        </figure>

        <p>Interestingly, the conversation that followed led to a completely different solution. Instead of any icons, we would have a small menu for each card with clear options of “more like this”, “less like this” and “save for later”.</p>

        <h4><strong>Final Prototype</strong></h4>

        <h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>

        <p>Working for openbook has been an incredible experience! I often felt that I was in over my head as a solo designer on such a large project, but it forced me to learn and improve quickly. At the end of the 4 week internship, I was offered a contract position as UX Engineer, and went on to learn even more new skills as I created a UI component library using <strong>Storybook</string> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>. I am so grateful to Jay, the founder of this startup, for trusting me with such an important part of the creation of this product!</p>
